# Fitness-Analysis-Using-Power-BI
This project analyzes workforce fitness based on age groups and gender to identify key drivers impacting workforce stability. The analysis uses fitness indicators such as BMI, activity index, and sleep hours to highlight areas of concern and provide actionable insights.

Key Findings
Only 40% of the population is physically fit, below the benchmark of 50–60%.
Average age is 49 years, with most individuals falling into the middle-aged to senior group.
Average BMI is 28, placing the majority in the overweight category
Average activity index is 3, indicating low engagement in physical activity. Target index should be 5–6.
Sleep hours are stable across all age groups (7–8 hours).
Males consistently show higher activity index than females across all age groups.
Young adults and middle-aged groups together account for nearly 78% of the fit population.

Metrics Analyzed
Activity Index by Age Group and Gender
Middle age males: 3.6
Middle age females: 2.94
Senior males: 3.10
Senior females: 2.97
Young adults (both genders): ~2.9

Sleep Hours by Age and Gender
Consistent average of 7–8 hours across groups
Fit Percentage by Gender and Age Group
Young Adults: 19.1% (male), 13% (female)
Young Adults + Middle Age: ~78% combined fit rate

BMI by Age and Gender
Middle age group has the highest average BMI (~28 for males, slightly below 28 for females)
BMI decreases slightly in senior group but remains close to overweight

Strategic Recommendations
Introduce joint-friendly and age-appropriate health programs for middle-aged and senior employees.
Increase engagement initiatives to raise the activity index from 3 to at least 5–6.
Target female workforce participation in fitness programs where gaps are evident.
Continue monitoring BMI trends and encourage balanced diets alongside physical activity.
